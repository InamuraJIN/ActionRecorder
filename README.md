# PLEASE!
Our workload has made it difficult for us to update and fix bugs<br>
New programmers are expected to be created!<br>
We have therefore made some major changes to the Action Recorder add-on<br>
For example, we have separated the Python files and added comments to make it easier for other programmers to understand<br>
Please Fork this add-on!<br><br>

# Action Recorder
Are you tirred of coding long intimidating coding task just for one-off modeling? Or may be you're not good coding at all !<br>
Introducing "ActionRecorder" !<br>

ActRec is an add-on developed to streamline your work in Blender<br>

This add-on is similar to Affinity Photo and Photoshop's "Action"<br>
This add-on has been reborn!
**Command Recorder --> Action Recorder**

This add-on is available for Free!<br>
But, It takes a lot of coffee to develop an Add-on!

# Add-ons Explained

Convert complex, repetitive tasks into one click!

You have to remember is "Add" & "Play" Only!

Supported Versions: 2.83 to 2.9

Simplify complex repetitive tasks, which were difficult to do with the standard “Repeat Last”(Shift+R) function of Blender, by registering multiple actions.

You can register, edit and play back various tasks as you wish

For example, with the touch of a button, you can do routine tasks such as adding instant coffee, milk and sugar while boiling water and adding hot water!

(I've thought about it a few times, but unfortunately this add-on only allows you to register work within Blender.)
